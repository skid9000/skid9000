## Who are you?

I'm skid9000, "skid" for short or Jarod IRL, i'm a system administrator student in France.

I'm native in French, somehow fluent in english and can understand some words of German, but don't expect too much :)

## What are you doing in your life?

Like i said i'm a student, tho since i'm bored 99% of the time at school, i do sysadmin stuff for my own needs and for [Anjara's](https://anjara.eu) needs, for more info go [here](https://jg-skid.me).

Sometimes i develop weird tools for weird usages or just for fun.

I also have a blog where i post stuff sometimes (like when i remember i have a blog), you can check it out [here](https://sblog.tuto-craft.com).
